                We will introduce a mentorship program at the high schools, specifically in the affected areas, where we will partner with the school administrators and collaborate with the counselling teachers to educate the teenage girls on sexual reproductive health education; focusing on the consequences of unprotected sex, contraceptives, and get them equipped with the knowledge to help them make an informed decision about their sexual life. We aim to collaborate with the local leaders of the community to assist us to host conversations and training on sexual reproductive health with the community members as the topic is sensitive. As the children are first teachers at home, they will play a key role in passing on the knowledge of SRHE to their children.

                We will introduce a career development program that will help the girls understand and identify their interests in specific career fields. After which, together with the school, we will organize a career symposium. We will invite women with successful careers in Freetown to share their stories and how they made it to where they are to inspire the girls that they can be whoever they dream of regardless of where they come from. Also, allocate them an adult female mentor who will hold them accountable for the academic and personal goals they set for themselves. This will serve as a source of motivation for the girls to pursue their education and do not allow anything to come in their way of success.

              <p class="description">
                These young teenage girls from underserved homes will be able to benefit and access training in hands-on skills, specifically how to sew reusable pads. The reason for teaching them this particular skill is they will get to be making themselves sanitary towels. Reducing the pressure of having to buy every time they are on menses, as sanitary towels are very expensive in Sierra Leone. Secondly, they can sell the sanitary towels at their communities at an affordable price for the other girls to benefit from it and make an income that will help them fund their education and survive in the hard situations at home. With a source of income, these young adults will overcome financial challenges that perpetrators who sexually abuse them use to take advantage of.

              During our first meeting with the parents they were a bit hostile to us. They thought teaching their children sexual education instead of protecting them we will spoil them. However, with the support of the community leaders we calmly explained to them that we are training the parents on sexual reproductive health education and they will teach their children basic knowledge bit by bit as they grow up. We then emphasised we are doing this to ensure the children are informed and protected from any form of sexual violence and abuse. Also with the children we will educate them on their rights and teach them the resources they could reach out to for help. They agreed and happily volunteered to participate in our trainings. The community outreach was the activity we as a team were so proud of as we got the opportunity to engage with both parents and children. The training lasted for a minimum of two months every year with the support of community leaders. We met with the parents and children every two months in a year. During this period, my team and I trained the parents on essential key sexual reproductive health topics to teach their children. Because they are the people most trusted by their children and youths can listen to. We encouraged them to form a close, healthy relationship with their children. In order for the children to open up to them and inform them if they face any form of sexual violence, and get to put a stop to such and protect their children.

<br>
<strong>With the children, we taught them their rights as children and the following:</strong>
<br>
&#8226; We taught them that no one should touch their private parts, and in case anyone does, let them report it to their parents and teachers at school.
<br>
&#8226; We also taught them and helped them memorize the child helpline which is 999, to report to police if they face any harassment or any form of child abuse.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Why are you proud of this activity? </strong> <br>
We are proud of this activity as both children and parents are informed on sexual education and health and children are fully informed of their rights and they know the resources and helpline to reach out to in case they face any sort of abuse. Again there is no better way of passing on this knowledge of sexual education than the children learning it at home as charity begins at home.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Result: In what way did your activity help children and youths?</strong>
<br>
The children got to know and understand their rights as well as get to know resources set up to offer them assistance in case they need help. 

<br>
<br>
<strong>Below is the impact that Weekes Foundation has had on my community:</strong>
<br>
&#8226; The community has become open to learning more about sexual education and willing to educate their young girls at home.
<br>
&#8226; The schools have embraced the campaign against teenage pregnancy. Teachers are committed to teaching and sharing knowledge on sexual reproductive health and rights.
<br>
&#8226; Community leaders become more motivated to fight cases of women abuse in the community and set policies for offenders brought to them.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Weekes Foundation</strong> has grown into a larger initiative aiming to build a community of strong, independent, and intelligent girls and young women who are not defined by their background nor allow it to determine their future. In Addition, we want to see a society where all girls and young women are liberated from abusive relationships and empowered to live by their values. To date, the Weekes Foundation has empowered and impacted 2,300 beneficiaries that have benefited from this initiative, of which are Parents, Children, Youths, Health Workers, Schools, and Communities. “Teenage pregnancy has contributed to Gender Inequality as many girls do not live up to their potential once they fall pregnant. To achieve Gender Equality we should all come together and support young adolescent girls to ensure they are equipped with the right information and have access to sexual health services to live to their full ability. Empower a girl to empower the nation.”
